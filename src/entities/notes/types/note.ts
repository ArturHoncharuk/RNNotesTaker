/* The code snippet is defining an interface named `Note` in TypeScript. This interface has two
properties: `id` of type `string` and `title` of type `string`. The `export` keyword makes this
interface accessible outside of the file where it is defined, allowing other parts of the codebase
to use the `Note` interface. */
